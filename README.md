# tango_with_django_project
Learning project from the book "Tango with Django"

## Security
This project utilizes a file named "settings_secret.py" which is NOT synced with this repo.  There is a template, "settings_secret.py.template", simply make a copy of this file, remove ".template" and the "SECRET_KEY" value to something strong, random, and not found in a dictionary.
